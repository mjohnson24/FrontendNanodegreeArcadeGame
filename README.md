# Frontend-Nanodegree-Arcade-Game
===============================

## Description:

This game is my 3rd project for the Udacity Front-End-Web-Development Nanodgree program. The goal is to create a classic arcage game called frogger using the newly acquired skills in Object-Oriented-Javascript and HTML5. Images and a game engine are provided. What i added is in app.js file and the extra player images in the engine.js file under Resources.load.

## How to Play:

Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the player across the board. To win you need to reach the water, but avoid colliding with the bugs. If you collide with the bugs you be reset to beginning and the score set back to zero.

# Enjoy the game!  :smile:
