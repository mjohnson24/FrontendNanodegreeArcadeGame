===============================

##Description:

This game is my 3rd project for the Udaicty Front-End-Web-Development Nanodgree program.  The goal is to create a classic arcage frogger game using the newly acquired skills in Object Oriented Javascript and HTML5 Canvas.  Images and a game loop engine are provided.  What i added is in app.js file!

##How to Play:

Use the arrow keys to move the player across the board. To win you need to reach water, but avoid colliding with the bugs.

#Enjoy the game!  :smile:
